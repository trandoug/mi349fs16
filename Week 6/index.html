			<h2>Eggroll</h2>

   				<p class="note">"This is a family recipe that i know how to make... but only in large portions. We literally kinda wing it every time."</p>
	  	        <img src="images/eggroll.jpg" alt="eggroll" /> <br>

	  	     

	        	<p>Aproximate cook time: 2hrs </p>
	        	<p>Prep time: 2hrs</p>
	        	<p>Ingrediants:</p>
	        		<ul>approximately 150 eggroll wrappers</ul>
	        		<ul>approximately 8 pounds of ground pork</ul>
	        		<ul>approximately 3 large jicamas</ul>
	        		<ul>approximately 10 pounds of carrots</ul>	  
	        		<ul>1 white onion</ul>
	        		<ul>1 bushel of green onion</ul>      		
	        		<ul>2 cups of sugar</ul>
	        		<ul>1/3 cup of salt</ul>
	        		<ul>1/4 cup of black pepper</ul>
	        		<ul>Enough oil for a deep fryer</ul>
	        		<ul>4 eggs</ul>

	        	<p>Typically, there should be a good ratio of pork, carrots, and jicama. Place the ground pork on one side a massive mixing bowl. Shred enough carrots and jicama so there will be at least 1/2 pork, 1/4 carrots, 1/4 jicama. Shred both green and white onion. Toss in Salt, sugar and pepper. Seperate the egg yolk and set it asside in a seperate bowl. Eggwhites go inside the mixing bowl as well. Mix well.  </p>
	        	<p>Place a spoonful of the mix onto the corner of an eggroll wrapper and roll into desired shape. Dip finger into the egg yolk and smear on opposite corner of the roll so that it binds the eggroll together. Deep fry! </p>

			<h2>Spring rolls with tofu</h2>

				<p class="note">"This is a variation of our family recipe. Technically it's like a burito where you can add anything you want. I decided to go a pineapple tofo, marinade... "</p>

	        	<p>Aproximate cook time: 15minshrs </p>
	        	<p>Prep time: 1hr</p>
	        	<p>Ingrediants:</p>
	        		<ul>Spring roll wraps</ul>
	        		<ul>1 Large Jicama</ul>
	        		<ul>1 Can of sliced pineapples</ul>
	        		<ul>1 drained pack of extra firm tofu</ul>	  
	        		<ul>4 cloves of garlic</ul>
	        		<ul>6 large eggs (optional)</ul>
	        		<ul>1 bag of cooked shrimp (optional)</ul>      		
	        		<ul>1 bushel of mint leaves</ul>
	        		<ul>1 bushel of cilantro</ul>
	        		<ul>1 liter of hoison sauce></ul>
	        		<ul>3 tbsp of peanut butter</ul>
	        		<ul>1 cup of crushed peanuts </ul>

	        	<p>Crush garlic and toss into pot of water. Shred Jicama and steam above the pot of water with the garlic. </p>

	        	<p>Slice tofu into 1/4 inch strips and marinade with the pineapple juice. </p>

	        	<p>Beat eggs together and cook on the stove so its like an ommlette. Slice into 1/4 inch slices. </p>

	        	<p>For the sauce, pour all hoison sauce on sauce pan and add peanut butter. Simmer and mix on low heat. </p>

	        	<p>Cook pineapple and tofu on pan.</p>

	        	<p>submerge spring roll wrap in warm water. Don't leave it in too long because if it is too wet and starts becoming into a foldable shape, it'll be much harder. Take it out and assemble, desired amount of jicama, egg, cooked pineapple, tofu, mint, cilantro and then roll. </p>
