I am on a path to graduate from Michigan State University with a Bachlor in media information technology in Spring 2017. Computer science was once my major, but in Spring 2016, I realized that it was a major not really fit for me. Even though the majority of the technical classes have been completed, there was never a feel of fulfilment.  </p>

                                                    <p class="h3mod-ex">Generally, I enjoyed dealing with computers. From building a computer from nothing, to troubleshooting everything I come across. They say technology brings great conviences, and I Agree. I also see them as rapidly changing industry that not everyone can keep up to. I for one Enjoy that challege. </p>
